####Master Mix:

Reagent | 1Rxn µl | 10 Rxn µl |  
---|---|---|---| 
Phire Taq Mix| 		7.5		|	75|
BSA	 (0.25mg/ml)	|0.14	|1.4
F primer FastP6.1 (10µM) |	0.195	|	1.95

Total volume 		|	15		|	150

####Thermal Cycling Conditions 
- [95°C 60 secondes] 1 cycle
- [95°C 30 sec,53°C 30 sec, 72°C 70 sec] 40 cycles
- [72°C 5 minutes] 1 cycle
- [15°C infinity]

####Sample
1: H1 Hollie 1 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
2: H2 Hollie 2 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
3: H3 Hollie negative extraction control 4/9/22   
4: P1 Pierrick 1 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
5: P2 Pierrick 2 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
6: P3 Pierrick negative extraction control 4/9/22   
7: H20 Negative PCR Control   
8: 253= Pocillopora gDNA  from E5 Terpis   

####Gel protocol
prepared a 50ml gel using 50ml of 1xTAE + 0.5g Agarose, melted gel for ~90 sec in the microwave and let cool and added 1µl Gelgreen

Ran the gel in 0.25X TAE to reduce heating in the Bento Lab, but had to move the gel to on of the OWl rigs in order to start the next PCR in the Bento Lab.

####Thermal Cycling Conditions   
- [98°C 5 minutes] 1 cycle
- [98°C 10 sec, 58°C 10 sec, 72°C 20 sec] 40 cycles
- 72°C 1 minute 1 cycle
- 15°C infinity
* The protocol calls for 5 second steps, but the Bento Lab shortest step time is 10seconds

####Samples
scraped samples from the coral plug 


P. acuta before scraping all 3 samples and after

1: Cl= Clip1 - largest piece ~2mm x 2mm   
2: C2= Clip2 - piece 1mm x 1mm   
3: C3= Clip3 - piece 0.5mm x 0.5mm   
4: Neg= H2O   
5: H1= Chelex 1   
6: 253= gDNA 253 Poc from E5 Terpis    
7: C4= Clip4 - Scraped w/pipette tip only   
8: P2 from above run again

####Gel protocol
prepared a 50ml gel using 50ml of 1xTAE + 0.5g Agarose, melted gel for ~90 sec in the microwave and let cool and added 1µl Gelgreen

Ran the gel in 0.25X TAE to reduce heating in the Bento Lab, but gel melting was still visible.

####Gel Results

![Phire Direct PCR Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/20220411_PhireDirectPCR_Gel.jpeg)

The clippings for the coral inhibited the PCR, the only sample that worked for the direct from tissue PCR was the "Clip 4" which was only coral tissue rubbed from the side of the plug with the pipette tip. The chelex sample H1 and the gDNA E5 sample 253 also worked. 

It seems less is more in this case, so this bodes well for taking swabs of the coral DNA from recruitment plates.
