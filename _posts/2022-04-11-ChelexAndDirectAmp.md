- F primer FastP6.1	(Added 50µl of stock 2mg/ml plus 950µl of Nuclease Free water and made 3 aliquots of ~320µl each and stored in reagent box at -20)    
- R primer RORF	(Added 50µl of stock 2mg/ml plus 950µl of Nuclease Free water and made 3 aliquots of ~320µl each and stored in reagent box at -20)    

[Chelex DNA Extraction](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Chelex_DNA_Extraction/) was completed on April 9th 2022 and DNA stored at -20°C

####Master Mix:

Reagent | 1Rxn µl | 10 Rxn µl |  
---|---|---|---| 
Phire Taq Mix| 		7.5		|	75|
BSA	 (0.25mg/ml)	|0.14	|1.4
F primer FastP6.1 (10µM) |	0.195	|	1.95
R primer RORF		|	0.195	|	1.95
DNA		|				1.5		| NA	
H2O			|			5.47	|	54.7
Total volume 		|	15		|	150

####Thermal Cycling Conditions 
- [95°C 60 secondes] 1 cycle
- [95°C 30 sec,53°C 30 sec, 72°C 70 sec] 40 cycles
- [72°C 5 minutes] 1 cycle
- [15°C infinity]

####Sample
1: H1 Hollie 1 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
2: H2 Hollie 2 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
3: H3 Hollie negative extraction control 4/9/22   
4: P1 Pierrick 1 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
5: P2 Pierrick 2 chelex extraction of P. acuta 4/9/22   
6: P3 Pierrick negative extraction control 4/9/22   
7: H20 Negative PCR Control   
8: 253= Pocillopora gDNA  from E5 Terpis   

####Gel protocol
prepared a 50ml gel using 50ml of 1xTAE + 0.5g Agarose, melted gel for ~90 sec in the microwave and let cool and added 1µl Gelgreen

Ran the gel in 0.25X TAE to reduce heating in the Bento Lab, but had to move the gel to on of the OWl rigs in order to start the next PCR in the Bento Lab.

Aliquot 13.5µl of master mix into each tube
    
    
####Thermal Cycling Conditions   
- [98°C 5 minutes] 1 cycle
- [98°C 10 sec, 58°C 10 sec, 72°C 20 sec] 40 cycles
- 72°C 1 minute 1 cycle
- 15°C infinity
* The protocol calls for 5 second steps, but the Bento Lab shortest step time is 10seconds

####Samples
scraped samples from the coral plug **P. acuta before scraping all 3 samples (left) and after (right)**
![Plug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/20220411_plug_sample.png)


1: Cl= Clip1 - largest piece ~2mm x 2mm   
2: C2= Clip2 - piece 1mm x 1mm   
3: C3= Clip3 - piece 0.5mm x 0.5mm   
4: Neg= H2O   
5: H1= Chelex 1   
6: 253= gDNA 253 Poc from E5 Terpis    
7: C4= Clip4 - Scraped w/pipette tip only   
8: P2 from above run again

####Gel protocol
prepared a 50ml gel using 50ml of 1xTAE + 0.5g Agarose, melted gel for ~90 sec in the microwave and let cool and added 1µl Gelgreen

Ran the gel in 0.25X TAE to reduce heating in the Bento Lab, but gel melting was still visible.

####Gel Results

![Phire Direct PCR Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/20220411_PhireDirectPCR_Gel.jpeg)

The clippings for the coral inhibited the PCR, the only sample that worked for the direct from tissue PCR was the "Clip 4" which was only coral tissue rubbed on the side of the plug with the pipette tip. The chelex sample H1 and the gDNA E5 sample 253 also worked. 

_**It seems less is more in this case, so this bodes well for taking swabs of the coral DNA from recruitment plates.**_
