## Extraction Protocol Steps


###Chelex Preparation
Prepare 5% Chelex  
- Make in small batches of ~45 mL (2.25 g chelex in 45mL of MilliQ H2O)

Pre-heat 5% Chelex solution to 95˚C prior to use for extraction

----------------

###Microcentrifuge tube (1.5mL) Chelex DNA extraction protocol   
	- Make sure Chelex is well-mixed and each tube receives chelex resin (the pipet tip should look a little cloudy with Chelex solution)    
-	Always include a negative control tube with no sample

1.	clipped 4 small 4mm^2 samples from Pocillopora acuta from the CBLS wetlab and added to 4/6 1.5ml microfuge tubes
	- Sample ID (H= Hollie Putnam, P = Pierrick Harnay)
		- 	H1=Pacuta clip1
		-  H2=Pacuta clip2
		-  H3= Negative control
		-  P1=Pacuta clip3
		-  P2=Pacuta clip4
		-  P3=Negative control
	- 
2.	Added 200 µL of pre-heated (95˚C) 5% Chelex
3.	Vortex for 30 sec   
	a.	Made sure tissue is still in the Chelex solution after vortexing
4.	Incubated at 95˚C for 15 minutes, vortexing every 5 min and also used the Eppendorf heated mixer at 500prm   
5.	Centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet Chelex and tissue (benchtop centrifuge)
6.	Pipetted ~180 µL of supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube
7.	Centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet Chelex and tissue 
8.	Pipeted 150 µL of supernatant to a new, labeled 1.5 mL tube   
a.		This is the final tube of extracted DNA so we labelled with sample name on the lid and the sample name, extraction date, and initials on the side   
b.		We stored at 4˚C for immediate use with the following gel, and the remainder was stored at -20˚C.

###Gel Electrophoresis of the DNA on the Bento Lab

[Bento Lab Gel Casting Instructions](https://bento.bio/resources/manual/gel-electrophoresis-and-transilluminator/#casting-a-gel)

1. Prepared a 1% agarose gel in 1x TAE with a 9 well comb from the Bento Lab   
	a. Melted 0.5g of agarose in 50ml of 1X TAE and poured gel 
2. Used 0.5X TAE as running buffer
3. Added two ladders and 6 samples in the following order
	Well 1. 10kb GeneRuler ladder 
	Well 2.H1
	Well 3.H2
	Well 4.H3
	Well 5.P1
	Well 6.P2
	Well 7.P3
	Well 8.100bp ladder
4. Ran the gel for 45 minutes at 50V

#### Gel Results
TAE gels are consistently melting at the top in the Bento Lab eletrophoresis chamber
